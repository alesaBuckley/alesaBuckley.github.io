It seems like a lucky oppourtunity unitl somebody takes it too far."

var DTRT01 = "The friends meet at a bowling alley after the news of the tuition. Fern, Jodie, and Merida (left to right) joke about the different brutal ways they could determine who should win to Elle (offscreen) who is not as lighthearted about the experiment. Aubrey (offscreen) attempts to distract the group from the news and ease Elle's mind by buying another bowling lane."

var DTRT02 = "When the girls arrive home from bowling, it seems all spirits are high again. As they settle in and begin playing a party game together, it becomes apparent that something is wrong with Merida. In almost the blink of an eye, her smile immediatly fades and she rushes out of the room, sick."
	
var DTRT03 = "Stirred from the mysterious nature of Merida's condition, everyone went to sleep early. As the girls were considering all the possibilities of what happened to their friend, they realize they can rule out mere coincidence. They find Jodie on the couch the next morning with the same symptoms Merida had the previous night. The girls realized this was no accident."
